**EGoTouchRev** is a community-driven, open-source replacement driver and service suite for proprietary capacitive touch controllers (primarily targeting Himax IC and accompanying BT-MCU stylus input). 

Developed entirely through clean-room reverse engineering, this project aims to provide a reliable, modular, and natively built touch interaction layer with an advanced algorithmic pipeline for Windows on ARM64 (WoA) devices.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Native System Service (`EGoTouchService`)**: A rock-solid, C++ driven Windows service (`LocalSystem`) handling continuous touch frame acquisition, lifecycle monitoring, and seamless HID report injection.
* **Hardware Integration**: Deep protocol-level integration with **Himax capacitive chips** for ultra-responsive multi-touch handling. *(Note: Active Stylus / BT-MCU integration is temporarily disconnected in this branch to focus on core touch stability)*.
* **Custom Processing Pipeline**: Overhauled from scratch with anti-jitter, anti-bounce, and 1 Euro filtering for unparalleled touch smoothing and coordinate accuracy.
* **Advanced Diagnostics**: Ships with `EGoTouchApp`, a native diagnostic GUI application (Diagnostics Workbench) for real-time visualization, raw data monitoring, and event logging.
* **100% ARM64 Native Deployment**: Fully customized WiX v4 build toolkit ensuring that no WOW64 emulation is required—deployment is completely native to modern ARM64 systems.

## 💻 Installation

We provide a **Pure ARM64 MSI Installer** packaged using the bleeding-edge WiX Toolset v4.

### Easy Install (End-Users)
1. Download the latest `EGoTouch_ARM64_v1.X.msi` from the [Releases](#) page.
2. Double click to run the setup wizard.
3. The installer will automatically deploy the binaries and configure `EGoTouchService` to launch silently in the background.

*(**Note**: Elevated Administrator privileges are strictly required to configure the system service).*

### Build from Source (Developers)

This project relies on **CMake** for code compilation and **WiX v4** for MSI packaging.

```bash
# 1. Compile the binaries
mkdir build & cd build
cmake .. -G "Ninja"
ninja

# 2. Package the MSI Installer (Requires .NET)
cd ..
wix build -arch arm64 scripts/EGoTouchSetup.wxs -ext WixToolset.UI.wixext -o build/EGoTouch_ARM64_v1.0.msi
```
